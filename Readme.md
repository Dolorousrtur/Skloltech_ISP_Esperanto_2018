<p>Resources you can use to learn Esperanto further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto: Teach Yourself Textbook (present in the repository)<br />I fount it a very useful textbook for learning on your own. It gives you a chunk of grammar info every lesson and then asks you to translate some texts using this knowledge. So it aims to make you practice the language and widen your vocabulary -- the things that lacked in our course.</li>
<li><a href="http://duolingo.com">Duolingo.com</a><br />Great website for learning languages. It has also English-&gt;Esperanto course and in a gamified manner makes you spend at least 10 min every day to learn and practice. Huge community of Esperanto learners included!</li>
<li><a href="https://lernu.net">Lernu.net</a>&nbsp;<br />Another website for esperanto learners. It contains profound Esperanto course, grammar explanations with multiple examples and active forum with discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Babilado interrete</strong></p>
<p>Where can you communicate with Esperanto-speakers on the internet?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://telegramo.org">Telegramo.org</a><br />There is a lot of Telegram chats crowded with Esperanto speakers. Here you can find a list of them. I especially advice you to look into the last section, it's a list of two-language chats, where you can speak about Esperanto in your native language.</li>
<li><a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/">Esperanto Stackexchange</a><br />Discussions on questions about Esperanto in English</li>
